## Feed Reader Testing

Given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds with an incomplete test suite, I had to complete the test suite to automatically test many aspecs of the site still work when new features are added.

#### How to view the project:

To view the project either clone this repository and open index.html, or you can view the site live here: http://maweeks.github.io/nano-fewd-06/

#### How to use the project:

Open index.html file in a browser and everything should run straight away.

The feed reader will load at the top of the page and the test suite will load at the bottom of the page.
